//Q. 1 Write a program to interchange two values by using Assignment Operator.
 
/*
# include <stdio.h>
# include <math.h>
int main()
{
	int a,b,c;
	printf("enter two numbers to be interchanged : ");
	scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
	c=b;
	b=a;
	a=c;
	printf("\ninterchanged numbers are : %d %d ",a,b);
	return 0;
}
*/

//Q. 2 Write a program to interchange two values by using Arithmetic Operator. 

/*
# include <stdio.h>
# include <math.h>
int main()
{
	int a,b,c;
	printf("enter two numbers to be interchanged : ");
	scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
	a=a+b;
	b=a-b;
	a=a-b;
	
	printf("\ninterchanged numbers are : %d %d ",a,b);
	return 0;	
}

//Q. 3 Write a program to interchange two values by using Bitwise Operator. // query 

//Q. 4 Write a program to find the size of all data types (Int, Float, Char, Double, Long Double, Short Int etc.). 

/*
# include <stdio.h>
# include <math.h>
int main()
{	
	printf("\nsize of  int is %d ",sizeof(int));
	printf("\nsize of  float is %d ",sizeof(float));
	printf("\nsize of  char is %d ",sizeof(char));
	printf("\nsize of  double is %d ",sizeof(double));
	printf("\nsize of  long double is %d ",sizeof(long double));
	printf("\nsize of  short int is %d ",sizeof(short int));
	
	return 0;	
}
